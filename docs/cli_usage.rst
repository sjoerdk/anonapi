Command Line Interface (CLI) setup
==================================
After :doc:`installation` you can use the CLI from any terminal via the keyword 'anon':

.. code-block:: console

    $ anon           # prints basic usage information

    $ anon status    # prints current configuration


CLI Commands
------------
use -h for help on any CLI command or subcommand. For example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ anon -h   # print overview of commands

    $ anon server -h   # print overview of all server subcommands


Add a server to the CLI
-----------------------
The CLI saves server locations locally for easy access. To add a server follow these steps:

First Find the url of an IDIS anonymization web API. An overview of servers within the radboudumc can be found
`here <https://repos.diagnijmegen.nl/trac/wiki/IDIS_web_API#servers>`_.

Lets say the server address is https://anonapi.org/server1. you can now add this server as 'server1':

.. code-block:: console

    $ anon server add server1 https://anonapi.org/server1

See a list of all servers known locally

.. code-block:: console

    $ anon server list

Activate server1. All subsequent commands will use this server.

.. code-block:: console

    $ anon server activate server1


Configure credentials
---------------------
To make calls to any IDIS web API, the CLI needs to know which credentials to use. Do the following:

Set your username. For radboudumc this is your z-number. To set z1234567 as your username:

.. code-block:: console

    $ anon user set_username z1234567

Obtain an API token. This might require your z-number password)

.. code-block:: console

    $ anon user get_token


Example commands
----------------
.. code-block:: console


    $ anon server jobs  # Show 50 most recent jobs on server

    $ anon job info 123  # Print extended info on job 123

    $ anon job cancel 123  # Cancel job 123

    $ anon job reset 123  # Restart job 123

Command Line Interface (CLI) reference
======================================

Overview of all CLI functions. For more information, use 'anon <function> -h' in the CLI itself

status
------
Display information on the command line tool itself. Which API servers it knows about, current active server.

.. code-block:: console

    $ anon status -h   # list all commands

server
------
Work with Anonymization server API servers. Add, remove servers, set active server.

.. code-block:: console

    $ anon server -h   # list all commands

job
---
Work with single jobs. Get extended info, reset, restart a job

.. code-block:: console

    $ anon job -h   # list all commands


user
----
Information and editing of credentials that are used to communicate with the API.

.. code-block:: console

    $ anon user -h   # list all commands


.. _batch:

batch
-----
Work with lists of jobs on a certain server. Anonymization jobs often occur in sets. With batches you can group
jobs together an do batch processing on them. A batch lives in a single folder. To work with a batch you have to be in
that folder. For example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd /tmp/my_folder
    $ anon batch info  # Will not work because there is no batch defined in this folder yet
    > Error: No batch defined in current folder

    $ anon batch init  # Create empty batch for the currently active server
    > Initialised batch for p01: https://apiservers/p01 in current dir

    $ anon batch info  # Now there is an empty list
    >  job_ids: []
        server:
          name: p01
          url: https://apiservers/p01

    $ anon batch add 1 2 3 # Now you can add job ids, separated by spaces
    $ anon batch info  # Now there is an empty list
    >  job_ids: ['1', '2', '3' ]
        server:
          name: p01
          url: https://apiservers/p01

    $ anon batch status  # Now you can print status for all ids in this batch
    > Job info for 3 jobs on p01: https://umcradanonp11.umcn.nl/p01:

          id     date                 status   downloaded processed  user
