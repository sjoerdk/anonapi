anonapi Documentation
=====================

The Anonymization server web API makes it possible to anonymize data either from disk or from PACS. It does so by
communicating with servers running `anonymization_server`_ code. You can use the anonapi lib in two ways:

* Via command line. This does not require programming knowledge. To quickly get going using the command line,
  see :ref:`quick_start`
* From python. This allows for more detailed control, but requires python coding knowledge. For more information on this,
  see :ref:`python_usage`
